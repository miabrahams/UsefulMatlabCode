A few useful econometric routines I have written. BSD license.

## OLS.m
Simple OLS for MATLAB. Matrices in, matrices out. Slope estimates, standard errors, t-tests, R2, etc. with matrix inputs. 

## Cluster_twoway.m
Two-way clustered standard errors. Implements Petersen's (2006) code for standard errors for clustering on two variables. This version is optimized for use on very large datasets. 

## VAR_NoBias_K.m
Bias-Corrected VAR. For bootstrapping VAR confidence intervals, implementing the Nicholls and Pope (1988) bias corrected VAR with the Kilian (1998) stationarity restriction.

## KP_RankTest.m
SVD Reduced Rank Test. Introduced by Kleibergen and Paap (2005).
